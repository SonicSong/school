# Are phones, internet and social media good?

Hello.
I was not once wondering if stuff like phones, internet and social media are good for young people.
I will be trying to focus on social media because most of young people actually use it non stop.
When thinking about social media in all you think of people just talking about various stuff but in reallity it isn't just that.
I saw not once when there was a war in comments because someone had diffrent opinion and I think it shows how bad actually social media are.
I will be also trying to show the positive things and negative things about social media here.
The final verdict is up to you.

Pros:
- People being able to share stuff they like.
- Massive amount of communities.
- People that help the other ones that are in need of help.

Cons:
- People arguing over nothing.
- Making a lot of dramas where it sometimes can end really bad.
- A lot of people are racist towards each other.
- Companies spying on their users and selling their data.

In my opinion Social media are partially good. There is a lot of good stuff about social medias but there is more cons than pros and there is still more probably to it.

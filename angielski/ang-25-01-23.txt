b)
1. I'd like to try paragliding and skydiving because it seems to be fun and a bit dangerous.
2. I think caving is really dangerous because there is a chance that you can get stuck in some hard to get place.
3. I think that snowboarding and white-water rafting is quite popular because of snow in the winter and there is a lot of rivers that serve as tourist attraction. Also I think that bungee jumping and skydiving is as popular as others as most of people think of it as really dangerous activity.
